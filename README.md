# Bootstraps

Basic bootstrapping approaches for estimation statistics, in Python.

## Overview

This repo collects some code for doing bootstrapping, primarily for computing confidence intervals, and for correlation measures.

Main functionality:
- using bootstrapping to estimate confidence intervals correlation measures
- compare the difference between correlations, using bootstrapping, confidence intervals, and estimated p-values

## Organization

- bootstrap.py: a collection of function for basic bootstrapping estimations
- bootstrap-corr.ipynb: a notebook which steps through the bootstrapping

## Requirements

- numpy
- scipy
- matplotlib

## License

This code is freely available for re-use / adaption / re-mixing etc - though with no guarantees of accuracy.
